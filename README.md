Data Description：
All 14,850 annotated color images have a size of 732×574, and include 11 categories of leukocytes, i.e., blast (Blast), promyelocyte (PRO), myelocyte (MYE), metamyelocyte (MET), band neutrophil (bNEU), segmented neutrophil (sNEU), lymphocyte (LYM),monocyte (MO), eosinophil (EO), basophil (BA) and reactive lymphocyte (rLYM). As well, the dataset include 4 non-WBC types, i.e., nucleated red blood cell (NRBC), giant platelet (gPLT), smudge (SM) and artefact (Artefact), for the model unified training.
